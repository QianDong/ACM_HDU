####CODE2 Description

>Notice that for every 48 numbers, the value will be the same, e.g. f(48)=f(0), f(49)=f(1), f(50)=f(2) ... 

>In the code, I made a vector instead of array, for the reason array is normally avoided in C++, sometimes you cross the boarder of it... But vector need to be cleared every time, I made a mistake in the beginning.
